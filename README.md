# Vizality Community - Applications

## Basic Requirements
If you've got a plugin you think would be a great addition to the [Vizality Community](https://github.com/vizality-community) org, we'd love to give it a chance. Let us know by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/vizality/vizality-community/issues/new/choose). When you've submitted, We'll check it and if it complies with our [guidelines](https://github.com/vizality-community/guidelines/blob/master/README.md), we'll give it the **Possible Addition** label<!--, and then we'll add a comment asking for you to transfer the repository to a staff member / developer, that will then transfer it to the repository <= need clarification -->.
> **Note**: Not all plugins that passes the requirements will be added.

## Okay okay, spill me all the beans 

> Make sure you've read Vizality's [guidelines](https://github.com/vizality-community/guidelines/blob/master/README.md)

### Get Listed
This is where you should be if you want to submit your own plugin or theme to be listed on our repository. So once you've create your awesome plugin or theme, you can start the application process by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/vizality-community/applications/issues/new/choose). Make sure you read Vizality's [guidelines](https://github.com/vizality-community/guidelines/blob/master/README.md) to see if it complies first.

### Browse
Want to check out all "officially recognized" plugins and themes created for Vizality by community members? You'll need to check out the [org](https://github.com/vizality-community).
> **Please note:** While we do vet all plugin code initially and periodically, we cannot ensure that they will always be used in a non-malicious way. Just know that you should still only be using these plugins at your own risk.

<!--
### Backends
If your plugin needs a backend, we're ready to let people host their backends and give a `*.vizality.com` URL.

But, because we don't have infinite processing power, there's a few rules:
- **Code must meet basic standards**, like reasonable security.
- **Lightweight**, we don't have infinite computer power.
- **Open Source**, the backend must be open sourced somewhere, preferably on GitHub.
- **Dependencies**, we don't want to have to install a trillion dependencies to run your backend.
-->
